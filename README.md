## Features

- **Autosquash** (`as`): Automatically squash all fixup commits in the current branch, cleaning up your commit history with interactive rebase. Perfect for consolidating work-in-progress commits.

- **Branch** (`b`): Quickly create a new branch from a freshly pulled BASE branch (defaults to main/master). Ensures you're always branching from the latest code.

- **Checkout** (`co`): Checkout a branch by name with fuzzy matching, or interactively select from a list of all local/remote branches. Supports `--remote` and `--all` flags for filtering.

- **CherryPick** (`cp`): Interactively select and cherry-pick commits from another branch using a fuzzy finder. Makes it easy to apply specific commits across branches.

- **DeleteBranches**: Safely delete all local branches whose remote tracking branches no longer exist. Helps keep your local repository clean.

- **Fixup** (`f`): Commit changes as a fixup commit that can later be automatically squashed with autosquash. Streamlines the process of fixing up previous commits.

- **Rebase** (`r`): Rebase the current branch on top of a freshly pulled BASE branch with a single command. Keeps your feature branches up to date.

- **Git Command Fallback**: For any git command not directly supported by lgit, the tool will automatically pass the command through to git, making lgit a drop-in replacement.

## Requirements

- **Git**: Version 2.0 or higher
- **Rust**: Version 1.70 or higher (if building from source)

You can check your versions:

```bash
git --version
rustc --version  # if building from source
```

## Installation

### Precompiled Binaries (Recommended)

[Download precompiled binaries for Windows, macOS and Linux](https://github.com/Luladjiev/lgit-rs/releases) from the releases page.

### Using Cargo

Installing through Cargo is the easiest way if you have Rust installed:

```bash
cargo install lgit
```

To update to the latest version:
```bash
cargo install lgit
```

### Building from Source

Clone and build the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luladjiev/lgit-rs.git
cd lgit-rs
cargo install --path .
```

### Troubleshooting Installation

**Cargo not found**: Install Rust and Cargo from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)

**Permission denied**: On macOS/Linux, you might need to add `~/.cargo/bin` to your PATH:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Old version**: Make sure you're getting the latest version:
```bash
cargo install lgit --force
```

## Quick Start

Here are some common workflows to get you started with lgit:

### Creating and Working on a Feature Branch

```bash
# Create a new feature branch from latest main
lgit branch feature/awesome-feature

# Make your changes, then commit as fixup for easy cleanup later
lgit fixup

# Make more changes, create another fixup
lgit fixup

# Squash all fixup commits when you're ready
lgit autosquash

# Keep your branch up to date with main
lgit rebase
```

### Branch Management

```bash
# Checkout a branch interactively
lgit checkout

# Clean up old branches whose remotes are gone
lgit delete-branches

# Cherry-pick commits from another branch interactively
lgit cherry-pick other-branch
```

### Using Git Commands

```bash
# Any git command works through lgit
lgit status
lgit log --oneline
lgit push origin main

# Explicitly pass commands to git with --
lgit -- branch -d old-feature
```

## Usage

To get a comprehensive list of all available commands and options, you can use the `--help` flag:

```bash
lgit --help
```

Each command has a dedicated help page that can be accessed by running `lgit <command> --help`. For example:

```bash
lgit branch --help
```

### Git Command Fallback

If you run a git command that is not directly supported by lgit, the tool will automatically pass the command through to git. This means you can use lgit as a drop-in replacement for git:

```bash
# These commands will be passed through to git
lgit status
lgit log --oneline
lgit diff HEAD~1
```

You can also explicitly execute git commands by using `--` followed by the git command:

```bash
# Explicitly pass commands to git using --
lgit -- status
lgit -- log --graph --all
lgit -- reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Command Examples

#### Autosquash
```bash
# Squash all fixup commits in current branch
lgit autosquash

# Squash last 3 commits
lgit as --number 3

# Squash commits since branching from main
lgit as --base main
```

#### Branch Operations
```bash
# Create branch from default base (main/master)
lgit branch my-feature

# Create branch from specific base
lgit b my-feature --base develop

# Interactive checkout
lgit checkout

# Checkout with fuzzy matching
lgit co my-feat  # matches "my-feature"

# List only remote branches
lgit co --remote

# List all branches (local + remote)
lgit co --all
```

#### Fixup Commits
```bash
# Create fixup commit with staged changes
lgit fixup

# Shorthand
lgit f
```

#### Cherry-pick
```bash
# Interactive cherry-pick from another branch
lgit cherry-pick feature/other-branch

# Shorthand
lgit cp main
```

#### Rebase
```bash
# Rebase current branch on freshly pulled main
lgit rebase

# Rebase on specific base branch
lgit r --base develop
```

#### Cleanup
```bash
# Delete branches whose remotes are gone
lgit delete-branches
```

## Configuration

lgit uses your existing git configuration and doesn't require additional setup. However, you can configure some behaviors:

### Default Base Branch

lgit automatically detects your main branch (main, master).

### Git Integration

lgit respects all your existing git configurations including:
- User name and email
- Remote configurations
- Git aliases
- Git hooks

## Why lgit?

lgit streamlines common git workflows by providing opinionated, high-level commands that combine multiple git operations. Here's how lgit compares to standard git commands:

| Task | Git Commands | lgit Command |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Create branch from latest main | `git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b feature` | `lgit branch feature` |
| Fixup and squash commits | `git add -A && git commit --fixup=HEAD~1 && git rebase -i --autosquash HEAD~3` | `lgit fixup && lgit autosquash` |
| Interactive branch checkout | `git branch -a` ‚Üí copy/paste branch name ‚Üí `git checkout branch` | `lgit checkout` |
| Clean up merged branches | `git branch -d branch1 && git branch -d branch2...` | `lgit delete-branches` |
| Rebase on latest main | `git checkout main && git pull && git checkout - && git rebase main` | `lgit rebase` |

### Key Benefits

- **Fewer Commands**: Complex workflows become single commands
- **Interactive Menus**: Fuzzy-finding for branches, commits, and more
- **Smart Defaults**: Automatically detects main branch, pulls latest changes
- **Safety First**: Confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- **Git Compatibility**: Drop-in replacement - all git commands still work
- **Workflow Focused**: Designed around real development workflows, not just git primitives

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Common Questions

**Q: Does lgit work with existing git repositories?**
A: Yes! lgit works with any existing git repository. It uses your current git configuration and doesn't modify your repository structure.

**Q: Can I use lgit alongside regular git commands?**
A: Absolutely. lgit is designed as a complement to git, not a replacement. You can mix lgit and git commands freely.

**Q: What happens if I run a git command that lgit doesn't support?**
A: lgit will automatically pass the command through to git, so `lgit status` works the same as `git status`.

**Q: Does lgit support git hooks?**
A: Yes, lgit respects all existing git hooks since it uses git under the hood.

### Troubleshooting

**"Command not found: lgit"**
- Make sure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your PATH
- Try running `cargo install lgit --force` to reinstall

**"Git command failed"**
- Ensure you're in a git repository: `git status`
- Check that git is working: `git --version`
- Verify you have the necessary permissions

**"No base branch found"**
- lgit looks for main or master branches
- Or specify manually: `lgit rebase --base your-branch`

**Interactive menus not working**
- Ensure you're using a compatible terminal
- Try updating to the latest version: `cargo install lgit --force`
- Check that your terminal supports interactive input

**"Branch already exists"**
- Use `lgit checkout existing-branch` to switch to existing branches
- Use `lgit branch new-branch` only for creating new branches

### Compatibility

- **Git Version**: Requires git 2.0+
- **Operating Systems**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Terminals**: Works with all major terminal emulators
- **Git Workflows**: Compatible with GitFlow, GitHub Flow, and custom workflows
